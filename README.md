# Wilco-Construction-SQL-Implementation-

Wilco Construction Company is a State Qualified Highway Contractor in Ohio.
The company was founded by Jack and Bob Wilson who make all the strategic decisions within the company. 
Bob’s friend, Frank Borman assists them in managing the operations at the job site. Jack’s wife Mary,
helped the company manage operations within the office. She works as a bookkeeper and took over 
office management few years ago. Wilco’s major client is State of Ohio, Highway Division which 
accounts for 90 % of its business.

A. Business Problem

On analyzing the case, there are four pertinent problems in Wilco Construction Company which needs to be addressed.
1) There is a lack of Reporting System within the organization. Company’s data and records
are stored and managed manually making the access to information more complicated. This makes 
it difficult for the company to comply with the new Ohio Equal Employment Opportunity 
(EEOC) policy passed by the legislation.

2) Manual and complicated calculations used to derive the paychecks made it difficult to see
a direct correlation between hours, wage and taxes. Different labor charges for different skillsets
and the distance of the Jobsite from Union Hall were also the factors which resulted into
Complexity in the Payroll Management.

3) Mary Wilson is the sole person who manages Wilco’s operations. All the documentation of the 
Company has to pass through Mary at least once. This makes it very difficult for her to function
efficiently in her tasks. Thus, the understaffed company needs managing staff to assist Mary,
and also a supervisor who will supervise various operations within the company, increasing its efficiency. 

4) Wilco, being a large contractor, has a significant amount of materials, small tools, heavy 
equipment and vehicles. Jack, who handles the administration, noted that it was tough to Manage 
Inventory and keep a track on issuance and maintenance of all the parts. The company got fined
$2000 by Occupational Safety and Health Organization (OSHA) by suspecting structural weakness in the boom. 

B. System Request

An apt business solution for the EEOC policy and also the problems listed above would be to design
an Automated Database system. This system will address the issues as follows:

1.	EEOC Policy:
The database will keep a track of employee details like gender, minority status and their skillsets. 

2.	Payroll Management:
We can also manage the complications in the payroll system using employee, project, skillset and
timecard details recorded in the database and thus make the Payroll calculation and documentation much easier. 

3.	Inventory Management.
The database will track the equipment and materials used in each project and also the inventory status.
We also added the feature wherein we can record the maintenance schedule of the equipment which
will help the company to use them efficiently without creating any problems in the project.


The project helps in listing the hours worked minority and non-minority categories under different job
classification. A check can be made if the total job hours worked by minorities is at least 10 % to comply
with Government EEOC regulations. The forms help in providing the rate of pay for each job
classification while maintaining the benefits and compensation associated with it. Furthermore, the
newly modified system enables us to list the total number of hours including regular and overtime
worked by every employee under each job classification. Internal information about the employees
could also be accumulated by the organization including name, phone, gender, marital status and EEO
code. Lastly, a weekly pay report can be distributed to every employee describing the statement of
earnings and deductions. This information could provide Income rate calculation as well based on
marital status and weekly income of the employees.
